# Recipe-Research-Client
In this application users are able to register an account and then log into that account. Afterwards they will be able to take advantage of the search functions to lookup recipes using an api. They can then view further details of that recipe by clicking a button and they will be given a link to the website where that recipe originated from.

For the purposes of showing off this demo an account has already been created:

Username: tester 
Password: password123

This will allow users to check the functionality of the application.
